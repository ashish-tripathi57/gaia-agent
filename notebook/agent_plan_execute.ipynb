This definition is broader than the culinary one, which typically refers to sweet, fleshy, and edible plant parts. Botanically, many items commonly considered vegetables are classified as fruits, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cucurbits:** cucumbers, pumpkins, squash\n",

      "\n",
      "Fruits are further classified based on their development and structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Simple fruits:** Develop from a single ovary of a single flower. These can be dry (like nuts or grains) or fleshy (like berries, drupes, or pomes).\n",
      "*   **Aggregate fruits:** Develop from a single flower with multiple ovaries, resulting in a cluster of small fruits (e.g., raspberries).\n",
      "*   **Multiple fruits:** Develop from an inflorescence (a cluster of flowers), where individual fruits merge into one mass (e.g., pineapples, figs).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some fruits are also classified as \"accessory fruits\" when parts of the flower other than the ovary contribute to the fruit's structure (e.g., apples, strawberries).\n",

These filaments, which emit radio signals, are thought to be remnants of a powerful event that occurred millions of years ago, possibly involving an outflow from the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. The article also mentions a newly discovered population of radial filaments that lie along the galactic plane and point towards the black hole, suggesting a connection to its activity. The origins of both types of filaments are still being investigated, with theories including cosmic-ray pressure, galactic winds, and interactions with the black hole's outflow.\n",
